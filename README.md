Just a simple calendar app made with django. You can use it to add events with short description, which will then be dislpayed on the calendar's page. There's also an authentication system added to it.

Made with the Hui Wen tutorial, 

## Technologies

Backend of the project has been created with Python 3.9.1, as well as:

* Django 3.1.5
* Psycopg2 2.9.1 and PostgreSQL 13.0 

## Launch

Listed Python and JS packages are required. By default the backend uses the PostgreSQL adapter for django, which actually is not neccessary for the application of this scope; the default sqlite will do just fine. 
Aside from setting up the database connection, there's not much to it. 

## Project status

Core functionality is operational.
